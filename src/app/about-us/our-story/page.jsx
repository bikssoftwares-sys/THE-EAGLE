            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
              The Eagle Generation was born out of a divine calling to raise Kingdom leaders who would transform Africa and beyond. Founded in Kenya, our movement started with a small group of young professionals and students who shared a vision for ethical leadership in marketplace, governance, and technology.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Recognizing the gap between the potential of young Africans and the leadership challenges facing our continent, we committed ourselves to mentorship, training, and community-building that would equip the next generation to soar above compromise.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
              What began as informal mentorship circles has grown into a comprehensive movement with active campus clubs in Kenyan universities, corporate training programs, governance workshops, and annual flagship events like the Eagles Summit and Hackathon.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
              We've trained thousands of students and professionals, facilitated strategic partnerships with corporate and technology leaders, and built a community of Kingdom-minded leaders committed to transformation.
